## Log of updates to ADRESSTools
**Basil - 21.02.2022:** 
-> Multiple bug fixes and improvement of PES / XPS analysis and curve fitting tools.

**Ajax - 24.11.2021:** Integration of PES / XPS analysis and curve fitting tools.

**v2.1 - 17.07.2020:** Massive upgrade to all UI systems and added several new features for analysis.

**v2.0 - 13.11.2019:** Further development of all UI's to make them all consistent;  
-> When saving on the 'arpes_processor' UI, it will now automatically also save an info .txt file.
-> Added new method in 'kf_analysis' that will track states by measuring the full-width at half-maximum as a function of a scan parameter. This method allowed for kF to be tracked automatically using the algorithm, with the user only defining the region of interest.
-> Added feature in 'kf_analysis' that will plot a summary video showing the fits as a function of the scan parameter.
-> Merging to master.

**v1.8 - 06.02.2019:** Further development of the 'arpes_statefitting' UI;  
	-> Added Voigt curve that can be fitted.
