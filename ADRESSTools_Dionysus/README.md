## Log of updates to ADRESSTools
**Dionysus - 22.10.2022:** 
-> Multiple bug fixes and improvement of PES / XPS analysis and curve fitting tools.
-> Improvement to figure aesthetics used in the codebase.
-> Updated GitHub Repo information and added several showcases of the functions available in ADRESSTools.
-> More generalised EF fitting function, allowing more accurate fits to the EF edge.
-> Updated angle -> wave-vector conversions to take into account new ADRESS geometry.

**Cronus - 28.09.2022:** 
-> Multiple bug fixes and improvement of PES / XPS analysis and curve fitting tools.
-> Updated Theory Data from Microsoft - all up-to-date now.
-> Added Physics Constants to Materials Database.
-> Uploaded MATools to 'Skyfall' version, with new ARPES geometry considered.

**Basil - 21.02.2022:** 
-> Multiple bug fixes and improvement of PES / XPS analysis and curve fitting tools.

**Ajax - 24.11.2021:** Integration of PES / XPS analysis and curve fitting tools.

**v2.1 - 17.07.2020:** Massive upgrade to all UI systems and added several new features for analysis.

**v2.0 - 13.11.2019:** Further development of all UI's to make them all consistent;  
-> When saving on the 'arpes_processor' UI, it will now automatically also save an info .txt file.
-> Added new method in 'kf_analysis' that will track states by measuring the full-width at half-maximum as a function of a scan parameter. This method allowed for kF to be tracked automatically using the algorithm, with the user only defining the region of interest.
-> Added feature in 'kf_analysis' that will plot a summary video showing the fits as a function of the scan parameter.
-> Merging to master.

**v1.8 - 06.02.2019:** Further development of the 'arpes_statefitting' UI;  
	-> Added Voigt curve that can be fitted.

**v1.7 - 18.12.2018:** Further development of the 'arpes_statefitting' UI;  
	-> Combined fit range and fit routine functions.

**v1.6 - 06.12.2018:** Developed all UI's to be mutually consistent in forms.

**v1.5 - 28.11.2018:** Developed the 'kf_analysis' UI.

**v1.4 - 26.11.2018:** Developed the 'bz_navigation' UI.

**v1.3 - 24.11.2018:** Developed the 'arpes_isoeanalysis' UI.

**v1.2 - 10.11.2018:** Developed the 'arpes_statefitting' UI.

**v1.1 - 05.11.2018:** Developed the 'arpes_processor' UI.

**v1.0 - 10.10.2018:** Single GUI to perform all processing and analysis.
